					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-12">
							<p>Currently, there are not many solutions that directly match our project with both an app and web app, however AR is becoming increasingly more accessible. However, there are
								apps that are similar as they also use AR to customise rooms and simulate items inside rooms. For example, the IKEA Place App that allows
							buyers to be able to see how furniture would fit before buying, launched in 2017. IKEA Place uses Apple's ARKit
							AR platform, allowing users to place "true-to-scale 3D furniture" anywhere [1].<br>
						One of the main problems the app faced was balancing the size of the models so that the furniture models retained their 
						texture and detail but didn't crash the app as soon over 4G [2]. Whilst we won't be making our own models, it's something 
					we've kept in mind as we consider our models.</p>
					<p>However the app is said to be extended into simulating the experience of walking through IKEA warehouses using AR [2],
							similar to our project where we simulate rooms via AR and then users will be able to interact with 3D objects
						inside the room. This however has yet to be implemented, hence we have no exact review of an existing solution. 
						<br><br>Another app, Figment AR, allows users to superimpose AR portals and emoji models onto the environment [3]. Similar to our project,
						these AR portals can be placed in rooms that show users different places; these portals can have 360 videos placed inside [4] and proves 
						to be a useful educational app for youths which we could emulate with our AR portals. However, this app doesn't customise
						a portal using a web app, and AR portals are preset whereas in our project, the rooms inside the portal will be customisable.

						<div class="col-lg-12">
							<p>The most widely used and accessible technology for AR apps is Unity; we considered VR in the early stages
								however when gathering requirements, we found that not many users would have access to
								VR technology and would render the application useless. As our client suggested, we chose that as our
								engine to start making our app. In addition, there were different AR SDK that we had to choose between. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-12">
							<p>3 popular options are ARCore (by Google), ARKit (which is used in the apps in the existing solutions section above), and PTC Vuforia.
								Our client wanted an Android app, so ARKit was dismissed as an option as it's only for iOS apps.
								<br> ARCore and Vuforia both support Android. Vuforia uses both ARCore and ARKit if the hardware can support it, 
							but requires paid versions to publish apps without a watermark. ARCore [5] has motion tracking, plane detection (of even angled surfaces),
						and light estimation which would be really useful for our app. </p>
